It was the first time that I gave a birthday present to my friend. á   She wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend.  The content of á the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy.á 	happiness								
It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I á had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that á I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld á have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period á - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice á experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable á fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright á prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my á brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue á I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased.	fear								
The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often á grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This á made me angry.	anger								
When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then á and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives á and my tears made me sad.	sadness								
At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid á doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch á together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had á promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime á after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize á his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a á university student and ought to have self-respect.  He á disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him á and did not want to keep any contact with him.	disgust								
My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were á his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.  á Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I á felt ashamed at having misunderstood him.	shame								
In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging á person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time á to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care á of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my á own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty.	guilt								
"In August,1983, the long awaited \big envelope\"" (a document for á"	happiness	knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly á	opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. á	" It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."""	1				
On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was á afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very á unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of á passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to á repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results á were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a á minor in this subject I would be very unwilling.	fear								
In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me \ A failure, You lost á	anger	"show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."""	1						
This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about á sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  á I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.	sadness								
My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had á melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played á the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell á him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right á to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to á leave the room and go somewhere else.	disgust								
Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was á working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had á joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female á classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not á fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I á realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I á said sorry to her and the matter came to an end.	shame								
I lied to one of my best friends.	guilt								
I received a letter from a distant friend.	happiness								
My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a á male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I á hung up and heard someone walking outside our door.	fear								
Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her á grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in á mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me á and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be á employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á child to teach.	anger								
I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had á prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After á three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and á failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others á would think that I had not prepared for it.	sadness								
I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the á door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit á and bring the germs in the house.	disgust								
I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I á was scolded immediately.	shame								
I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when á I called out loudly.	guilt
