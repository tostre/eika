"That's interesting, but check this out. I date her",joy,positive
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction,neutral,neutral
"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",neutral,neutral
Yeah well we should order some food then.,neutral,neutral
"No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll",neutral,neutral
That sounds fair.,neutral,neutral
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street,neutral,neutral
Ah yeahwait a second now!,anger,negative
Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,neutral,neutral
I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,anger,negative
"Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.",neutral,neutral
"All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.",neutral,neutral
So let's decide on the spending limit,neutral,neutral
"Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?",neutral,neutral

"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",neutral,neutral
"Oh yes, well there's the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",joy,positive
"Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",neutral,neutral
"Yes, I realize that",neutral,neutral
"And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",neutral,neutral
I love working with designers!,joy,positive

Hypothetically!,anger,negative
Still.,neutral,neutral

"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",anger,negative
"Oh god, my eye!""",anger,negative
